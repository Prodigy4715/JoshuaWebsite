   This code and this website was made by me to present my skills as a web developer! I have presented this website as a resume a sorts and I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java to make this website 
 function. It tells a bit about me and also presents the practicality of my coding to my future employers as well as talk about other interests I have.
