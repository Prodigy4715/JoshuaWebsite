            <h2 class="first"> What's this website about?</h2>
            <p class="first">Hi! My name is <strong>Joshua Bren.</strong> This is a website I have started ever since the beginning of June 2025, and this website was made
                to host my abilities of working in web development as well as a personal project of mine to talk a bit about myself to others about my interests,
                work experiences, and personal life. You can scroll through the many sections of this website to get a better idea of what's going on here and maybe
                even find some <em>secrets</em> as well as new projects inside this website that I will continue to be working on.
